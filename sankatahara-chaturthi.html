Sankashti Chaturthi (Sankatahara Chaturthi) is a celebration dedicated to the elephant God, Ganesh, the all-mighty power of our universe. It is believed that fasting and worshiping Lord Ganesh on the day of Sankashti Chaturthi brings us more health and wealth. This fast is mainly observed when people undergo terrible sadness and intolerable problems (Sankashtas) in their life. This day of fasting also brings us the blessings of the Moon God as well. This day happens to be the fourth day after the Poornima, which is also called Pournami (full moon day). There is a reason behind the celebration of Sankashti Chaturthi.

The Moon God was very proud of his beauty, which increased his arrogance and made him think of himself as the most beautiful God of all gods. Lord Ganesh wanted to teach him a lesson in kindness and started playing with the Moon God. When the Moon God entered Kailash to have the darshan of Lord Shiva and Parvathi, Lord Ganesh tried to block him on his way. The Moon God, instead of wishing Lord Ganesh, started laughing at him without knowing his power for his elephant face and human body. Hence, Lord Ganesh cursed him with a dark shade and shapeless structure, which took away all his brightness from the Moon God's face.

The Moon God then realized his mistake and started worrying about his behavior. Later, he went to Lord Shiva and Parvathi to recount the whole incident that took place between him and Lord Ganesh and asked the couple for a solution to his mistake. As he had realized his arrogance and prideful speech, the couple guided him with a solution that could only be done by Lord Ganesh. The Moon God went back to Ganesh, apologized for his mistakes, and asked him to forgive him for his behavior. Lord Ganesh then blessed him with a boon stating that he would remain dark and dull for half of every month and start growing brighter little by little in the other half of every month.

On the day of Sankashti Chaturthi, it is believed that getting the darshan of Lord Ganesh and seeing the Moon will bring the blessings of the Moon God as well. To remember this incident and also to promote kindness and modesty to the people, Sankashti Chaturthi is celebrated.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the pooja of Sankashti Chaturthi starts only after sunset, i.e., during the evenings when the moon rises, making it the perfect time for the pooja. This ritualistic observance is performed with great devotion and involves offerings of various sweets, fruits, flowers, and other items to Lord Ganesh. It is believed that observing Sankashti Chaturthi with sincerity and devotion can help overcome all obstacles and bring success and prosperity in one's life.
